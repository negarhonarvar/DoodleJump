# How to Play 
Utilize the j and k keys on your keyboard to control the balls movement. The character automatically jumps upon landing on a platform. Your objective is to leap from one platform to another, ascending to higher levels. Be cautious not to fall off the screen or collide with obstacles. Keep an eye on the red bugs that lurk within the game! Make sure to steer clear of them as they can hinder your progress. Additionally, be cautious of green platforms, as they are broken and should be avoided.
